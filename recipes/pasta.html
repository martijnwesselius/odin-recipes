    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 zucchini</li> 
        <li>200 grams of peas</li>
        <li>300 grams of whole wheat pasta</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>2 handfuls of basil</li>
        <li>20 grams of cashew nuts</li>
        <li>10 grams of pine nuts</li>
        <li>Juice of Â½ lemon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>Pepper and salt</li>
        <li>Optional: extra pine nuts, cherry tomato and arugula</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Toast the cashew nuts and pine nuts briefly in a pan until they are brown. Cook 
            the pasta according to the package.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the avocado pesto: in a food processor, blend the avocado, 
            garlic, basil, cashew nuts, pine nuts, nutritional yeast and lemon juice into 
            a creamy pesto. Season it with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the zucchini into slices and grill them in a grill pan until they have 
            nice stripes. When the pasta is cooked, drain it and mix in the pesto. Return 
            to low heat for a while and then add the peas, stir them into the pasta until 
            the peas have thawed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the pasta with the grilled zucchini and finish with pine nuts, cherry 
            tomatoes and arugula.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tip: don't have a grill pan? You can also roast the zucchini in the oven. Mix 
            the zucchini slices with a little olive oil and put them in the oven for 20 
            minutes at 200 degrees.
        </li>
    </ol>
